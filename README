Quite simple at this stage. (Because it's the first thing I've ever done)
Reads names from first.txt and second.txt and generates a gated community name.
Just run gcng in python and it spits out a name.

Stuff I want to add:
Gated community names right now are quite simple and mainly Florida based.
Maybe later, I'll offer a "Southwest" option.
I also want to make this into a website. Likely using Django,
but maybe just Javascript is an option. Stay tuned.
