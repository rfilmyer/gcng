The Gated Community Name Generator.

Quite simple at this stage. (Because it's the first thing I've ever done)
Reads names from `first.txt` and `second.txt` and generates a gated community name.
Just run `gcng` in python and it spits out a name.

Recent changes:
* Now a module! (To make some changes I'm about to do easier)
* Function name is PEP 8-friendly!

Stuff I want to add:
Gated community names right now are quite simple and mainly Florida based.
Maybe later, I'll offer a "Southwest" option.
I also want to make this into a website. Likely using Django,
but maybe just Javascript is an option. Stay tuned.
